The kernel configuration files in this directory are meant to be used
as a base for an Android kernel configuration. All devices should have
the options in android-base.cfg enabled. While not mandatory, the
options in android-recommended.cfg enable advanced Android features.

Assuming you already have a minimalist defconfig for your device, a
possible way to enable these options for pyramid would be:

** Merge BASE settings **
ARCH=arm scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh arch/arm/configs/pyramid_defconfig android/configs/android-base.cfg

** Merge RECOMMENDED settings **
ARCH=arm scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh arch/arm/configs/pyramid_defconfig android/configs/android-recommended.cfg
